# foobar

I had the opportunity to try the Google [foo.bar](
https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) challenge in the Fall of 2016. 

I wish I could say it got me a job at Google, but it did not. I can say, however, that it was fun, engrossing, and an overall good experience. I'm glad I had the chance to do it. I had been on a break from my career while I started my family, and I wanted to return to work. While brushing up on my python skills, the challenge popped up on my search.

Anyway, it's been a while, and I figured I'd post what I had for anyone that might be interested. I'd love feedback, especially if it's constructive.
